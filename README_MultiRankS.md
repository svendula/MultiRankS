## MultiRankS_funs.R 

Functions description:

  - `gather.results`: gather the estimate (mean over bootstraps) and standard error for each object
  - `run.adaptiveMCMC.bootstrap`: run adaptive MCMC on each bootstrap sample 
  - `run.adaptiveMCMC.batchmeans`: run adaptive MCMC and calculate SEs with batch means method
  - `calculate.averaged.minima`: looking up the minimum in each chain and corresponding +-X points
  - `generate.bootstrap.samples`: generate bootstrap rank matrices
  - `generate.random.rank.matrix`: generate an examplematrix of rankings of objects (rows) by rankers (columns)
  - `norm_vec`: normalises a vector in order to have unit norm
  - `st.error.estim`: calculates standard error
  - `mean_sterr`: calculates standard error and the mean of the values
  - `F_perm`: calculates rank probability matrix for window height of specified maximum
  - `J_theta`: evaluates the objective function for a specified probability matrix
  - `FRgeneral`: given a vector and input matrix, calculates a rank matrix most similar to the input one
  - `what.is.suitable.sigma`: estimates a standard deviation needed to create the most similar rank matrix (see `FRgeneral`)
  - `real.fitness`: calculates the probability matrix for a current rank matrix estimate and compares to the observed rank matrix with `J_theta`
  - `MCMC.metropolis`: runs `onerun` function as many times as there are specified initial guesses (`theta.inis`). Distributes the run into a specified number of cores.
  - `onerun`: runs the function `run_metropolis_MCMC` and summarises its results
  - `run_metropolis_MCMC`: runs classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a specified fixed step size
  - `proposalfunction`: calculates a next step proposal in Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
  - `adaptive.MCMC.metropolis`: runs `onerun.adaptive` function as many times as there are specified initial guesses (`theta.inis`). Distributes the run into a specified number of cores.
  - `onerun.adaptive`: runs the function `MCMC` of package adaptMCMC, i.e. adaptive Metropolis algorithm, as described in Vihola, M. (2012). Robust adaptive metropolis algorithm with coerced acceptance rate. Statistics and Computing, 22(5):997â€“1008.
