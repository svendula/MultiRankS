# MultiRankS

MultiRankS is an R tool for estimating the underlying signal from multiple ranked lists. It takes a matrix of ranks as an input, where rankers are in columns and ranked objects in rows. It outputs an estimated real signal value for each object. These signals are responsible for the rankings in a sense that they are the true values that the rankers intended to rank. The tool also calculates the standard errors of the signal estimates using either Metropolis-Hastings or adaptive MCMC optimisation.

## Source code
The code can be loaded in R using devtools:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("svendula/MultiRankS")
```

If this does not work (because of proxy for example), you need to save the file `MultiRankS_funs.R` locally and run the script in R using `source('MultiRankS_funs.R')`.

[`MultiRankS_funs.R`](https://github.com/svendula/MultiRankS/blob/master/MultiRankS_funs.R): The source code of the algorithm.

[`README_MultiRankS`](https://github.com/svendula/MultiRankS/blob/master/README_MultiRankS.md): a description of all the functions in [`MultiRankS_funs.R`](https://github.com/svendula/MultiRankS/blob/master/MultiRankS_funs.R)


## Example of usage
Set up parameters (generally, larger values add to precision but also computatinal time)
```r
source('MultiRankS_funs.R')
p = 5 # number of objects
n = 10 # number of rankers
l_max = 2 # maximum height of the sliding window 
num.boot = 10 # number of bootstrap samples 
chain.length = 1000 # length of the MCMC chain
num.sim = 5 # number of independent chains
```
Create a random matrix of ranks `R.input` - objects in rows, rankers in columns:
```r
R.input = generate.random.rank.matrix(p,n)
```
Create bootstrap matrices
```r
boots = generate.bootstrap.samples(R.input,num.boot)
```
Calculate the list of probability matrices for the input:
```r
F.input = F_perm(R.input, l_max) 
```
Run adaptive MCMC
```r
results.by.boot = run.adaptiveMCMC(F.input, boots, num.sim, chain.length)
estimate = gather.results(results.by.boot)
```

## Application example in the reference article

The application example in the paper above was based on data from:

Fortney, K., Griesman, J., Kotlyar, M., Pastrello, C., Angeli, M., Sound-Tsao, M., and Jurisica, I. (2015). Prioritizing therapeutics for lung cancer: an integrative meta-analysis of cancer gene signatures and chemogenomic data. *PLoS Computational Biology*, 11(3):e1004068. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004068>

We used a subset of 30 drugs, out of which 10 were ranked at the top of the 247 most significant drugs chosen by Fortney et al. (2015) as those consistently reversing lung cancer gene changes. The remaining 20 drugs were chosen randomly.
