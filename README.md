# Estimating the underlying signal from multiple ranked lists
Vendula Svendova, Michael G. Schimek

## Application example

The application example was based on data from:

Fortney et al. (2015). _Prioritizing therapeutics for lung cancer: an integrative meta-analysis of cancer gene signatures and chemogenomic data_. PLoS Computational Biology. 11(3). <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004068>

We used a subset of 50 drugs, out of which 10 were ranked at the top of the 247 most significant drugs chosen by Fortney et al. (2015) as those consistently reversing lung cancer gene changes. The remaining 40 drugs were chosen randomly.

The data from Fortney et al. were provided under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, allowing for the data's reuse, redistribution, and adaption, providing the authors and original source are cited. For full terms see <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.
