Vendula Svendova, Michael G. Schimek

Here the source code and genomic application data and results are provided.

## Source code

[`MultiRankS_funs.R`](https://github.com/svendula/Estimating-the-underlying-signal-from-multiple-ranked-lists/blob/master/MultiRankS_funs.R): The source code of the algorithm.

[`README_MultiRankS`](https://github.com/svendula/Estimating-the-underlying-signal-from-multiple-ranked-lists/blob/master/README_MultiRankS.txt): a description of all the functions in [`MultiRankS_funs.R`](https://github.com/svendula/Estimating-the-underlying-signal-from-multiple-ranked-lists/blob/master/MultiRankS_funs.R)

[`Example.md`](https://github.com/svendula/Estimating-the-underlying-signal-from-multiple-ranked-lists/blob/master/Example.md): An example of 10 objects and 10 assessors, that can be ran provided the source code 


## Application example

The application example was based on data from:

Fortney et al. (2015). _Prioritizing therapeutics for lung cancer: an integrative meta-analysis of cancer gene signatures and chemogenomic data_. PLoS Computational Biology. 11(3). <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004068>

We used a subset of 30 drugs, out of which 10 were ranked at the top of the 247 most significant drugs chosen by Fortney et al. (2015) as those consistently reversing lung cancer gene changes. The remaining 20 drugs were chosen randomly.

The data from Fortney et al. were provided under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, allowing for the data's reuse, redistribution, and adaption, providing the authors and original source are cited. For full terms see <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.
